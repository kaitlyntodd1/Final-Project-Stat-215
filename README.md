The variables selected for this analysis are the different genders that lead the conversations more often, conversation topics, number of times income inequality is mentioned, and number of times addiction is mentioned. The methods used to collect the data are observational in nature. The collection of data was through the examination of two episodes on Netflix as well as the recording of observations. 

The first variable, gender that leads the conversation more, was measured on a categorical scale of 1-3 by noting the speaker in the majority of the episodes in singular conversations. These categories included women, men, and neither gender led the conversation. These variables are given a number of 1, 2, or 3. The coding scheme used is exclusive since it allows each conversation to be controlled either by a woman, man, or a man and woman speaking the same amount of time without either actually leading the conversation. 
The next variable is what the conversation topic is. There are three different categories the topic could fall into. Conversations about work which would be labeled as 1, conversations about relationships/sex/and other sexual activities which would be labeled as 2, and other conversations which would be labeled by 3. The coding scheme is exclusive because there is no overlap between the categories.

	The third variable, number of times income inequality is mentioned, represents the amount of times a character hints at or mentions income inequality in a conversation within an episode. The variable was measured through examining how many times an individual mentioned something that relates to struggling financially such as being poor or needing money. The values are quantitative because they are measured on a scale from 1-10, 1 being the shortest amount of times and 10 being the highest amount. The measure is exclusive and valid because it reveals if the conversations are frequently occurring or not. 
 
The fourth variable, number of times addiction is mentioned, represents how commonly mentioned addiction is within a conversation in an episode. The variable was measured through examining how many times addiction is mentioned or hinted at. These values are quantitative because they are represented by counting. The measure is strong because it will reveal if these conversations are frequent or not.

	This project requires the examination of episodes through the show “Shameless” on Netflix. It also requires a clear understanding of the variables through the episodes and no biases.
